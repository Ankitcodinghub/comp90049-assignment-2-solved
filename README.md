Overview

The goal of this project is to build and critically analyse some supervised Machine Learning algorithms, to automatically identify the genre of a song on the basis of its audio, metadata and textual features. That is, given a list of songs, your job is to implement one or more Machine Learning model(s), train them using the training dataset, and evaluate using the test validation and test dataset.

This project aims to reinforce the largely theoretical Machine Learning concepts around models, data, and evaluation covered in the lectures, by applying them to an open-ended problem. You will also have an opportunity to practice your general problem-solving skills, written communication skills, and creativity.

This project has two stages. At Stage I, the focus will be the implementation, experimentation, and the report, where you will demonstrate the knowledge that you have gained, in a manner that is accessible to a reasonably informed reader. At Stage II, you will review 2 reports written by your peers in Stage I and submit a review of about 200-400 words.

Deliverables

(a) The predicted labels of the test songs submitted to the Kaggle InClass Competition described below

(b) (1) One or more programs, written in Python, which implement Machine Learning models, make predictions, and evaluate and (2) a README file that briefly details your implementation.

(c) An anonymous written report, of 1800Â±10% words. Your name and student ID should not appear anywhere in the report, including the metadata (filename, etc.).

(a) Reviews of two reports written by other students, of 200-400 words each.

Dataset

Each song (instance) is represented through a large set of features (described in detail in the README), and listed in the features.csv files. Each song is labelled with a single genre tag, which is provided in the labels.csv files.

The data files are available via the LMS. You will be provided with a set of training, validation and test instances. The files are provided in csv format, which stands for comma-separated values.

â€¢ train features.csv: Contains features of 7678 training instances.

â€¢ train labels.csv: Contains a single genre label for each training instance

â€¢ valid features.csv: Contains features of 450 validation instances.

â€¢ valid labels.csv: Contains a single genre label for each validation instance.

â€¢ test features.csv: Contains features of 428 test instances.

Each song in the data set is indexed with a unique trackID. We provide three different types of features. Details are provided in the README file, as well as the references listed under Terms of Use:

â€¢ Metadata features: For each song, we provide its title, loudness, tempo, key, mode, duration, and time_signature .

â€¢ Text features: For each song, we provide a list of tags representing the words that appeared in the lyrics of the song and are human annotated (such as â€˜danceâ€™, â€˜loveâ€™, or â€˜never).

â€¢ Audio features: We provide 148 pre-computed audio features that were pre-extracted from the 30 or 60 second snippets of each track, and capture timbre, chroma, and â€˜Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficientsâ€™ (MFCC) aspects of the audio. Each feature is continuous and the values are not interpretable.

Each song is labelled with its genre, i.e., with a single label from one of 8 possible genre labels:

â€˜Soul and Reggaeâ€™, â€˜Popâ€™, â€™Punkâ€™, â€˜ Jazz and Bluesâ€™, â€˜Dance and Electronicaâ€™, â€˜Folkâ€™, â€˜Classic Pop and Rockâ€™, â€˜Metalâ€™

Task

You will develop Machine Learning models which predict the music genre based on a diverse set of features, capturing audio features of the track, as well as song metadata such as its title, key, duration, and textual tags representing the words in the song lyrics. You will implement and analyze different Machine Learning models in their performance; and explore the utility of the different types of features for music genre prediction.

We will use a hold-out strategy to evaluate the trained model using a validation, and a test set:

1. The training phase: This will involve training your classifier(s) and parameter tuning where required.

You will use the train features and train lyrics files.

2. The validation phase: This is where you observe the performance of the classifier(s). The validation data is labelled: you should run the classifier that you built in the training phase on this data to calculate one or more evaluation metrics to discuss in your report. This phase will help you to find the best model that can be used for the testing phase.

3. The testing phase: The test data is unlabeled; you should use your preferred model to produce a prediction for each test instance, and submit your predictions to Kaggle website; we will use this output to confirm the observations of your approach.

N.B: Various Machine Learning techniques have been (or will be) discussed in this subject (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, 0-R, etc.); many more exist. You are strongly encouraged to make use of existing Machine Learning libraries (such as sklearn) in your attempts at this project.

Submissions

Submissions: Stage I

Submission in Kaggle InClass Competition

Report

The report should be 1800Â±10% words in length and provide a basic description of:

1. The task, and a short summary of some related literature

2. What you have done, including any learners that you have used, or features that you have engineered

3. Evaluation of your classifier(s) over the validation dataset

You should also aim to have a more detailed discussion, which:

4. Contextualises the behaviour of the method(s), in terms of the theoretical properties we have identified in the lectures

5. Attempt some error analysis of the method(s) And donâ€™t forget:

6. A bibliography, which includes Bertin-Mahieux et al. (2011), as well as A. Schindler and A. Rauber (2012), and other related work

Note that we are more interested in seeing evidence of you having thought about the task and determined reasons for the relative performance of different methods, rather than the raw scores of the different methods you select. This is not to say that you should ignore the relative performance of different runs over the data, but rather that you should think beyond simple numbers to the reasons that underlie them.

We will provide LATEXand RTF style files that we would prefer that you use in writing the report. Reports are to be submitted in the form of a single PDF file. If a report is submitted in any format other than PDF, we reserve the right to return the report with a mark of 0.

Your name and student ID should not appear anywhere in the report, including any metadata (filename, etc.). If we find any such information, we reserve the right to return the report with a mark of 0.

Code

You must submit one or more programs, written in Python, which implement Machine Learning models, make predictions, and evaluate as well as a README file that briefly details your implementation. Note that you are strongly encouraged to use existing Machine learning libraries (such as sklearn) in your attempt at building a model. Your code must include the following functions:

â€¢ train(): where you build your Machine Learning model from the training data.

â€¢ predict(): where you use your trained model to predict a class for the validation data.

â€¢ evaluate(): where you will output the accuracy of your model based on an evaluation metric.

Submissions: Stage II

At stage II you have to submit the following reports:

Reviews

During the reviewing process, you will read two anonymous submissions by other students. This is to help you contemplate some other ways of approaching the Project, and to ensure that students get some extra feedback. For each paper, you should aim to write 200-400 words total, responding to three â€™questionsâ€™:

â€¢ Briefly summarise what the author has done in one paragraph (50-100 words)

â€¢ Indicate what you think that the author has done well, and why in one paragraph (100-200 words)

â€¢ Indicate what you think could have been improved, and why in one paragraph (50-100 words)

Assessment Criteria

The Project will be marked out of 40, and is worth 40% of your overall mark for the subject. The mark breakdown will be:

You will explain the practical behaviour of your systems, referring to the theoretical behaviour of the Machine Learning methods where appropriate. You will support your observations with evidence, in terms of evaluation metrics, and, ideally, illustrative examples. You will derive some knowledge about the problem of music genre prediction.

You will produce a formal report, which is commensurate in style and structure with a (short) research paper. You must express your ideas clearly and concisely, and remain within the word limit (1800Â±10% words). You will include a short summary of related research.The marking rubric indicates what we will be looking for in each of these categories when marking.

You will write a review for each of two reports written by other students; you will follow the guidelines stated above.

For submitting (at least) one set of model predictions to the Kaggle competition.

Using Kaggle

The Kaggle InClass Competition URL will be announced on LMS shortly. To participate do the following:

â€¢ Each student should create a Kaggle account (unless they have one already) using your Student-ID

â€¢ Submissions will be evaluated by Kaggle for accuracy, against just 30% of the test data, forming the public leaderboard.

â€¢ After competition closes, public 30% test scores will be replaced with the private leaderboard 100% test scores.
